Abstract
========

Since its initial inception, the UDP Tracker Protocol has seen widespread
adoption by the BitTorrent ecosystem.  It is by far the dominant tracker
protocol in use, dwarfing the earlier HTTP-based protocol.  However, the
current version of the UDP protocol used to today does not include any method
of adding extensions or additional features.  Worse, previous versions of the
protocol have described contradictory, incompatible methods.  This BEP defines
a new extension mechanism that allows new features to be easily added without
breaking the existing protocol.

Overview
========

The original UDP Tracker specification [1]_ was written by Olaf van der Spek in
2004, for use with his xbtt-tracker.  An additional specification was written
by Arvid Norberg for rasterbar.com [2]_ in 2005, referencing Olaf's earlier
work.  These two specifications are almost identical, differing only in how
user authentication and future extendibility is handled.  Unfortunately, these
differences are significant enough to make the two specifications incompatible
with one another when either of these optional features is used.

In 2008, the BitTorrent Enhancement Proposal (BEP) process was put in place to
codify many of the improvements that had been made to BitTorrent since it was
first released.  The same year, Olaf authored BEP-15 [3]_ to once again
document the UDP Tracker Protocol.  BEP-15 is largely based on his earlier
specification, but differs in that it does not include any form of
authentication, or define any extension mechanism, stating only: *"Extension
bits or a version field are not included.  Clients and trackers should not
assume packets to be of a certain size. This way, additional fields can be
added without breaking compatibility."*

As a result, BEP-15 can be thought of as describing the least common denominator
of the two specifications that came before it, and is the most interoperable
version that has ever been documented.  More importantly, there do not appear
to be any existing trackers or clients in use today that implement any of the
user authentication methods or extension mechanisms that were described in the
earlier specifications.  It is therefore possible for us to safely define a new
extension mechanism, so long as care is taken not to conflict with the existing
protocol.

This document defines such an extension mechanism.  This mechanism is completely
optional, and is backwards compatible with the existing protocol.  It has been
widely deployed in uTorrent since version 3.2.2 (released in October, 2012)
and is not known to cause any problems communicating with existing trackers.

Motivation
==========

Prior to the extensions defined in this document, UDP tracker URLs that
contained PATH and QUERY components were completely valid, but those components
were invisible to the tracker.  For example, from the tracker's perspective, the
URL:

        ``udp://tracker.example.com:80/dir?a=b&c=d``

and the URL:

	``udp://tracker.example.com:80``

were completely indistinguishable.  This differs from the HTTP-based Tracker
Protocol, and places restrictions on how a UDP tracker URLs may be used in
practice.

Our primary motivation was to develop an extension to the UDP protocol to allow
the PATH and QUERY components to be sent to UDP trackers.  Rather than
implementing a protocol change that only addressed this one issue, we chose to
define an extension mechanism to allow future extensions to be easily added
without risk of breaking the existing protocol.


Extension Format
================

The extension mechanism we chose is modeled after the one used in IP and TCP
packets [4]_.  Extensions are defined by a series of *options*, which can define
new behavior.

Option parsing starts immediately at the end of a valid UDP Announce Request
packet as defined by BEP-15 (at byte offset 98), and continues until either the
end of the UDP packet is reached, or an *EndOfOptions* option is encountered,
whichever happens first.  The *EndOfOptions* option allows the protocol to be
further extended in the future, should this extension mechanism not prove to be
as flexible as we hope.

Each option made up of either one, two, or three fields:

	- 1 byte that identifies the option-type
	- 1 byte that specifies the length of the associated data that follows
	- A variable-length data field.

Most options have all three fields.  For option-types that include a length,
the length field does not include the 2 bytes consumed by the option-type field
and the length field itself in its total.  A length field of zero indicates
that the data field has been omitted, and that the very next byte is either the
option-byte for the next option, or the end of the packet.

There are only two special-case options that use only the first field: *NOP*,
and *EndOfOptions*.  Any options added in the future are required to include a
length field.  This ensures that an extension parser written today can safely
skip over any unknown option-types that may be defined in subsequent BEPs.

This document defines one option which uses all three fields: *URLData*

This extension mechanism only allows options to be sent by the client, and only
in the Announce Request packet.


Option Types
============

The complete list of currently defined options is as follows:

	*EndOfOptions*:   *<Option-Type 0x0>*
		A special case option that has a **fixed-length** of one byte.
		It is **not** followed by a length field, or associated data.
		This option indicates that option parsing should stop.  Use of
		this option is optional; option parsing continues until either
		the end of the packet is reached, or an *EndOfOptions* option is
		encountered, whichever happens first.

	*NOP*:   *<Option-Type 0x1>*
		A special case option that has a **fixed-length** of one byte.  It
		is **not** followed by a length field, or associated data.  A
		*NOP* has no affect on option parsing.  It is used only if
		optional padding is necessary in the future.

	*URLData*:   *<Option-Type 0x2>*, *<Length Byte>*, *<Variable-Length URL Data>*
		A variable-length option, followed by a **length byte** and
		**variable-length** data.  The data field contains
		the concatenated PATH and QUERY portion of the UDP tracker URL.
		If this option appears more than once, the data fields are
		concatenated.  This allows clients to send PATH and QUERY
		strings that are longer than 255 bytes, chunked into blocks
		of no larger than 255 bytes.

To reiterate, it is critical that option parsers know which option-types are
followed by a length byte, and which are not.  Option-types **less than or equal
to 0x1** are **never** followed by a length byte.  Option-types **greater than or
equal to 0x2** are **always** followed by a length byte.  Additionally, when a
length-byte is present, option parsers must always be prepared for the length
field to be zero, indicating no associated option data accompanies this option.

Examples
========

A client communicating with a tracker at the URL:

        ``udp://tracker.example.com:80/dir?a=b&c=d``

might include the following extension bytes in its UDP Announce Request packet,
at byte offset 98, describing an *URLData* option to inform the tracker the full
URL the client is using::

	0x2, 0xC, '/', 'd', 'i', 'r', '?', 'a', '=', 'b', '&', 'c', '=', 'd'

The following extensions bytes would be equally valid, and evaluate
identically.
Here, the *URLData* option is followed by two *NOPs*, to position the next
option on a 32-bit word-boundary.  The final option is an *EndOfOptions*::

	0x2, 0xC, '/', 'd', 'i', 'r', '?', 'a', '=', 'b', '&', 'c', '=', 'd', 0x1, 0x1, 0x0

This is admittedly a convoluted example, constructed to demonstrate the use of
the *NOP* and *EndOfOptions*.

As a final example, a client communicating with a tracker at the URL:

	``udp://tracker.example.com:80``

might include the following extension bytes in its UDP Announce Request packet,
containing the *URLData* option with a length-byte of zero::

	0x2, 0x0

A client may wish to send an empty *URLData* option to indicate that it
supports the *URLData* extension, but that no PATH or QUERY components were
present in the tracker URL it used.


Use Cases
=========

The initial problem we were attempting solve was how to run a high-performance
tracker while restricting the infohashes it would serve.  Using a whitelist file
was quickly ruled out, due to the large number of infohashes to be supported,
and a requirement to support adding new infohashes very frequently and quickly.

The mechanism we chose used a public-key signature system to cryptographically
sign each valid infohash.  This was first developed using an HTTP-based
tracker, where the infohash signature could easily be included in the tracker
URL.  This had the advantage of allowing us to deploy the system with complete
interoperability with existing clients.  But, we also wanted to support UDP
trackers, for better performance, which led to the creation of this extension
mechanism.

As an example, a tracker URL might be:

	``udp://tracker.example.com:80/?auth=0x00000000000000000000``

Where the string "0x00000000000000000000" is the public-key signature of the
infohash.  A tracker which receives this QUERY string can authenticate the
signature using the public-key.  New valid tracker URLs can be created offline
using the secret-key.

Implementations
===============


uTorrent versions since 3.2.2 (released in October, 2012) have supported
this extension mechanism, including support for the *URLData* option.

BitTorrent, Inc has patched OpenTracker to support this extension mechanism,
including support for the *URLData* option, and uses the QUERY string to
authenticate valid infohashes as described in the previous section.  The patch
uses Ed25519 [5]_ as the public-key signature system.  We intend to release
this patch as an Open Source contribution to OpenTracker in the near future.
