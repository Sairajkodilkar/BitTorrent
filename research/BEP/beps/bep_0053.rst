Abstract
========

This magnet extension introduces the concept of an optional *select-only* file index array in the magnet URI, so that torrent clients can automatically select specific file(s) for download after the metadata has been downloaded.

Rationale
=========

This extension would allow clients to know which specific file(s) within a torrent they should download, before the metadata has been downloaded. In particular it would allow for creating "deep links" to a specific file, folder, or subset of files within a torrent. A server could then host a magnet link, referring to that specific file or subset of files they wish to serve. This would be particularly useful for library torrents.

This extension would add an *optional* array of file indices to the magnet link.

URI extension
===============
The new URI format would contain the following:

``magnet:?xt=urn:btih:HASH&dn=NAME&tr=TRACKER&so=0,2,4,6-8``

- ``so=0,2,4,6-8`` means *select only*, and the numbers are the file indices. Files are zero-indexed. Dashes mean inclusive ranges, so 6,7, and 8 are also added.

Special case: What if the magnet link is already added? 

Torrent clients that already have added that torrent should add any currently not-downloading file indices, and set their priority to normal.
