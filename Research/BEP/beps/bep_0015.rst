Introduction
============

To discover other peers in a swarm a client announces it's existance
to a tracker.  The HTTP protocol is used and a typical request
contains the following parameters: info_hash, key, peer_id, port,
downloaded, left, uploaded and compact.  A response contains a list of
peers (host and port) and some other information.  The request and
response are both quite short.  Since TCP is used, a connection has to
be opened and closed, introducing additional overhead.

Overhead
========

Using HTTP introduces significant overhead. There's overhead at the
ethernet layer (14 bytes per packet), at the IP layer (20 bytes per
packet), at the TCP layer (20 bytes per packet) and at the HTTP layer.
About 10 packets are used for a request plus response containing 50
peers and the total number of bytes used is about 1206 [1].  This
overhead can be reduced significantly by using a UDP based
protocol. The protocol proposed here uses 4 packets and about 618
bytes, reducing traffic by 50%.  For a client, saving 1 kbyte every
hour isn't significant, but for a tracker serving a million peers,
reducing traffic by 50% matters a lot.  An additional advantage is
that a UDP based binary protocol doesn't require a complex parser and
no connection handling, reducing the complexity of tracker code and
increasing it's performance.

UDP connections / spoofing
==========================

In the ideal case, only 2 packets would be necessary. However, it is
possible to spoof the source address of a UDP packet.  The tracker has
to ensure this doesn't occur, so it calculates a value (connection_id)
and sends it to the client.  If the client spoofed it's source
address, it won't receive this value (unless it's sniffing the
network).  The connection_id will then be send to the tracker again in
packet 3. The tracker verifies the connection_id and ignores the
request if it doesn't match.  Connection IDs should not be guessable
by the client. This is comparable to a TCP handshake and a syn cookie
like approach can be used to storing the connection IDs on the tracker
side.  A connection ID can be used for multiple requests. A client can
use a connection ID until one minute after it has received
it. Trackers should accept the connection ID until two minutes after
it has been send.

Time outs
=========

UDP is an 'unreliable' protocol. This means it doesn't retransmit lost
packets itself. The application is responsible for this.  If a
response is not received after 15 * 2 ^ n seconds, the client should
retransmit the request, where n starts at 0 and is increased up to 8
(3840 seconds) after every retransmission.  Note that it is necessary
to rerequest a connection ID when it has expired.

Examples
========

Normal announce::

  t = 0: connect request
  t = 1: connect response
  t = 2: announce request
  t = 3: announce response

Connect times out::

  t = 0: connect request
  t = 15: connect request
  t = 45: connect request
  t = 105: connect request
  etc

Announce times out::

  t = 0:
  t = 0: connect request
  t = 1: connect response
  t = 2: announce request
  t = 17: announce request
  t = 47: announce request
  t = 107: connect request (because connection ID expired)
  t = 227: connect request
  etc

Multiple requests::

  t = 0: connect request
  t = 1: connect response
  t = 2: announce request
  t = 3: announce response
  t = 4: announce request
  t = 5: announce response
  t = 60: announce request
  t = 61: announce response
  t = 62: connect request
  t = 63: connect response
  t = 64: announce request
  t = 64: scrape request
  t = 64: scrape request
  t = 64: announce request
  t = 65: announce response
  t = 66: announce response
  t = 67: scrape response
  t = 68: scrape response

UDP tracker protocol
====================

All values are send in network byte order (big endian). Do not expect
packets to be exactly of a certain size. Future extensions could
increase the size of packets.


Connect
--------

Before announcing or scraping, you have to obtain a connection ID.

1. Choose a random transaction ID.
2. Fill the connect request structure.
3. Send the packet.

connect request::

  Offset  Size            Name            Value
  0       64-bit integer  protocol_id     0x41727101980 // magic constant
  8       32-bit integer  action          0 // connect
  12      32-bit integer  transaction_id
  16

1. Receive the packet.
2. Check whether the packet is at least 16 bytes.
3. Check whether the transaction ID is equal to the one you chose.
4. Check whether the action is connect.
5. Store the connection ID for future use.

connect response::

  Offset  Size            Name            Value
  0       32-bit integer  action          0 // connect
  4       32-bit integer  transaction_id
  8       64-bit integer  connection_id
  16

Announce
--------

1. Choose a random transaction ID.
2. Fill the announce request structure.
3. Send the packet.

IPv4 announce request::

  Offset  Size    Name    Value
  0       64-bit integer  connection_id
  8       32-bit integer  action          1 // announce
  12      32-bit integer  transaction_id
  16      20-byte string  info_hash
  36      20-byte string  peer_id
  56      64-bit integer  downloaded
  64      64-bit integer  left
  72      64-bit integer  uploaded
  80      32-bit integer  event           0 // 0: none; 1: completed; 2: started; 3: stopped
  84      32-bit integer  IP address      0 // default
  88      32-bit integer  key
  92      32-bit integer  num_want        -1 // default
  96      16-bit integer  port
  98

1. Receive the packet.
2. Check whether the packet is at least 20 bytes.
3. Check whether the transaction ID is equal to the one you chose.
4. Check whether the action is announce.
5. Do not announce again until interval seconds have passed or an event has occurred.

Do note that most trackers will only honor the ``IP address`` field under limited circumstances.


IPv4 announce response::

  Offset      Size            Name            Value
  0           32-bit integer  action          1 // announce
  4           32-bit integer  transaction_id
  8           32-bit integer  interval
  12          32-bit integer  leechers
  16          32-bit integer  seeders
  20 + 6 * n  32-bit integer  IP address
  24 + 6 * n  16-bit integer  TCP port
  20 + 6 * N
  

IPv6
''''

IPv6 announces have the same structure as v4 ones, including the used ``action`` number except that the stride size of ``<IP address, TCP port>`` pairs in the response is 18 bytes instead of 6.

That means the ``IP address`` field in the request remains 32bits wide which makes this field not usable under IPv6 and thus should always be set to 0.

Which format is used is determined by the address family of the underlying UDP packet. I.e. packets from a v4 address use the v4 format, those from a v6 address use the v6 format.

Clients that resolve hostnames to v4 and v6 and then announce to both should use the same ``key`` for both so that trackers that care about accurate statistics-keeping can match the two announces.   
  

Scrape
------

Up to about 74 torrents can be scraped at once. A full scrape can't be done with this protocol.

1. Choose a random transaction ID.
2. Fill the scrape request structure.
3. Send the packet.

scrape request::

  Offset          Size            Name            Value
  0               64-bit integer  connection_id
  8               32-bit integer  action          2 // scrape
  12              32-bit integer  transaction_id
  16 + 20 * n     20-byte string  info_hash
  16 + 20 * N

1. Receive the packet.
2. Check whether the packet is at least 8 bytes.
3. Check whether the transaction ID is equal to the one you chose.
4. Check whether the action is scrape.

scrape response::

  Offset      Size            Name            Value
  0           32-bit integer  action          2 // scrape
  4           32-bit integer  transaction_id
  8 + 12 * n  32-bit integer  seeders
  12 + 12 * n 32-bit integer  completed
  16 + 12 * n 32-bit integer  leechers
  8 + 12 * N

If the tracker encounters an error, it might send an error packet.

1. Receive the packet.
2. Check whether the packet is at least 8 bytes.
3. Check whether the transaction ID is equal to the one you chose.

Errors
------

error response::

  Offset  Size            Name            Value
  0       32-bit integer  action          3 // error
  4       32-bit integer  transaction_id
  8       string  message

Existing implementations
========================

Azureus, libtorrent [2], opentracker [3], XBT Client and XBT Tracker
support this protocol.


Extensions
==========

Extension bits or a version field are not included. Clients and
trackers should not assume packets to be of a certain size. This way,
additional fields can be added without breaking compatibility.

See BEP 41 [4] for an extension negotiation protocol.
