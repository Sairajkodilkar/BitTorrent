This extension extends the tracker response to better support IPv6 peers as
well as defines a way for multi homed machines to announce multiple addresses
at the same time.  This proposal addresses the use case where peers
are either on an IPv4 network running Teredo_ or peers are on
an IPv6 network with an IPv4 tunnel interface.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in IETF `RFC 2119`_.

Announcing
==========

An announce to the tracker should be made for each local IP address:

	1. the client intends to receive incoming peer connections over (listens on)
	2. the client intends to publish to the tracker
	3. that can be used as the source address in packets sent to the tracker (at
	   least one of the addresses the tracker hostname resolves to).

Each announce should use the corresponding local IP address as the source
address of the connection.

The source address is set on a socket using the ``bind()`` call, before connecting.

This applies to TCP connections, for HTTP and HTTPS trackers, as well as UDP
announces, to UDP trackers.

The client SHOULD include a ``key`` parameter in its announces.
The key should remain the same for a particular infohash during
a torrent session. Together with the ``peer_id`` this allows trackers
to uniquely identify clients for the purpose of statistics-keeping when they
announce from multiple IP .

The key should be generated so it has at least 32bits worth of entropy.

IP announce parameters
======================

An earlier version of this BEP specified new HTTP parameters to announce an
additional address of a different address family than the source IP address of
the tracker connection (``&ipv4=`` and ``&ipv6=``). These are discouraged, as
they allow an attacker to announce a victim's IP address to launch a DDoS
attack.

Announce Response
=================

In case the tracker does not support the ``compact`` response as
described in `BEP-23`_, no change is necessary. Since the
original ``peers`` response returns peer endpoints in their expanded
string form, IPv6 addresses can be passed back this way.

In case a compact response is requested, the tracker MAY add another key
to the response; ``peers6``. This key has the same layout as ``peers`` in
compact mode, but instead of using 6 bytes per endpoint, 18 bytes are used.
peers6 contains address-port pairs where the addresses are all IPv6.

Examples
========

Example response::

	d8:intervali1800e5:peers6:iiiipp6:peers618:iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiippe

Rationale
=========

The naming of ``peers6`` is chosen not to collide with the current ``peers``
response and to be backwards compatible. It is also a simple addition to the
current response, using the same encoding.
